## üöÄ Getting Started

### What is PM Jira Agent?

PM Jira Agent is an AI-powered system that automatically converts your simple requests into professional, high-quality Jira tickets. It uses advanced AI agents to research context, validate technical feasibility, and create tickets that meet "Definition of Ready" standards.

### How long does it take to create a ticket?

**2-3 seconds** for the AI processing, plus the time it takes you to write your request. Total time is typically under 2 minutes vs 30+ minutes manually.

### What makes the tickets "high-quality"?

Each ticket is:
- ‚úÖ Researched using your existing documentation
- ‚úÖ Reviewed by AI tech lead for feasibility
- ‚úÖ Scored on 5 quality dimensions (‚â•0.8 required)
- ‚úÖ Formatted with proper user stories and acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ Validated against business rules and company policies

- Why it's needed (business value)
- Who will use it

**Helpful:**

## üéØ Quality & Standards

### What is the quality score?
