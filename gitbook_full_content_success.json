Currently, Sx records are generated based on sales orders originating from Pyxis and Tempo systems. This ticket aims to refine this process to ensure data accuracy, prevent duplication, and optimize resource allocation. The enhancements will consider edge cases and potential discrepancies between the sales order data in Pyxis/Tempo and the resulting Sx records in AHS/SOP. We will investigate the current business rules to identify areas for improvement and automation.",
